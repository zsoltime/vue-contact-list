# Day 7 of My Vue.js Challenge

This is the seventh day of my [Vue.js challenge](https://github.com/zsoltime/vue-basic-challenge), and I'm building a basic contact list. 👩‍💻👩🏻‍💻👩🏾‍💻👨🏾‍💻👨🏻‍💻👨‍💻

## User stories

- [x] I can see a list of my existing contacts
- [ ] I can add new contacts
- [ ] I can edit and delete contacts
- [ ] I can sort contacts by name or the date added
- [ ] I can search my contacts
- [ ] My contacts are saved to my browser's local storage, so I can refresh the page without losing them
